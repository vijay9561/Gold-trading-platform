                Please note, once an order for purchase or sale has been confirmed by the customer, refunds or cancellation is not possible. All orders are final upon customer confirmation

Deliveries are made only to the registered address of the customer. Please keep proof of identity ready at the time of delivery as it may be required for verification by the courier partner. If no one is available at the registered address to take delivery, delivery will be attempted at least once more after which the package will be returned to the vault and the customer's balance will be credited back with the corresponding grams of gold. Shipping charges will be payable again as and when the customer asks for delivery.

Customers are required to verify that the package they are accepting has not been tampered with and is of acceptable quality. Once delivery has been taken by the customer, returns and refunds are not possible. All of our products are 100% certified and there should never be any problems with quality. In the unlikely event of any issues, please contact <a href="mailto:support@suvarnasiddhi.com">support@suvarnasiddhi.com</a> we will investigate the matter to resolve any concerns or issues.
